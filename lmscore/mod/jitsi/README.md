This module allows creating jitsi-meet videoconference sessions. If you have a jitsi-meet videoconference server, with this add-on you can create videoconference sessions in a course. You just have to configure the server domain (ip or url) and then in the course create a new Jitsi activity. It allows to create jitsi sessions to open on a specific date.

Atention:
- It is necessary to have a jitsi server so that it can work.
- The microphone and camera only work on https.
